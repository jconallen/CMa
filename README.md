## The CMa Virtual Machine Implementation</h3> 


I created this 100% client side JavaScript implementation of the CMa Virtual Machine as described in the
text [Compiler Design: Virtual Machines](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783642149085) by Reinhard Wilhelm 
and Helmut Seidl in preparation for a course I was about to take at 
[Aspen University DCS904](http://www.aspen.edu/degrees/doctoral-degree/doctorate-of-science-in-computer-science/classes).  
The text arrived early and the class wasn't to start for a couple of weeks so I decided to have some fun and 
implement the C virtual machine described in chapter 2 of the text as both 
a means of killing time and providing some insights into the material in the text.

Well, I certainly hit the mark on the first one. On the second goal, however I think I have found a number 
of discrepancies in the text and there were a lot omissions of detail that I had to guess at.  I tried to fill
in those gaps with this resource I found on the net; 
[cma.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20150505175118/http://www.rw.cdl.uni-saarland.de:80/teaching/cc07/project/cma.pdf)) but it too seemed 
to be little out of sync with the text.

It is currently hosted here on GitHub: [CMa Virtual Machime](https://jconallen.github.io/CMa/).


So all I can say is that **this implementation (still incomplete) may not match exactly the machine as described in 
the text** or the PDF.  But at least it works and so far seems reasonable consistent.
