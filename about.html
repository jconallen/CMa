    			The CMa Virtual Machine Implementation

		<p>
		I created this 100% client side JavaScript implementation of the CMa Virtual Machine as described in the
		text <a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783642149085">Compiler Design: Virtual Machines</a> by Reinhard Wilhelm 
		and Helmut Seidl in preparation for a course I was about to take at 
		<a href="http://www.aspen.edu/degrees/doctoral-degree/doctorate-of-science-in-computer-science/classes">Aspen University DCS904</a>.  
		The text arrived early and the class wasn't to start for a couple of weeks so I decided to have some fun and 
		implement the C virtual machine described in chapter 2 of the text as both 
		a means of killing time and providing some insights into the material in the text.</p>
		<p>
		Well, I certainly nailed the first one. On the second goal, however I think I have found a number 
		of discrepancies in the text and there were a lot omissions of detail that I had to guess at.  I tried to fill
		in those gaps with this resource I found on the net (updated with link to wayback version, since this was taken off of original location0; 
		<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150505175118/http://www.rw.cdl.uni-saarland.de:80/teaching/cc07/project/cma.pdf" target="_blank">cma.pdf</a> but it too seemed 
		to be little out of sync with the text. 
		</p>
		<p>
		The full source is available on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/jconallen/CMa">CMa</a> where you create any issues
		when you find them.  No guarantees that I will fix them, but if I need to kill some time I just might.
		</p>
		<p>
		So all I can say is that <b>this implementation (still incomplete) may not match exactly the machine as described in 
		the text</b> or the PDF.  But at least it works and so far seems reasonably consistent.
